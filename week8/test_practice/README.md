## Working with arrays
1. Being given a string of bytes representing a text (succession of words separated by spaces), determine which words are palindromes (meaning may be interpreted the same way in either forward or reverse direction); ex.: "cojoc", "capac" etc.
2. Two byte strings s1 and s2 are given. Build the byte string d such that, for every byte s2[i] in s2, d[i] contains either the position of byte s2[i] in s1, either the value of 0.

## Console
1. Read two numbers a and b (base 10) from the keyboard and calculate: (a+b)*(a-b). The result of multiplication will be stored in a variable called "result" (defined in the data segment).
2. Read numbers (in base 10) in a loop until the digit '0' is read from the keyboard. Determine and display the biggest number from those that have been read.

## Files
1. A text file is given. Read the content of the file, count the number of special characters and display the result on the screen. The name of text file is defined in the data segment.
2. A file name and a text (defined in the data segment) are given. The text contains lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits and special characters. Transform all the uppercase letters from the given text in lowercase. Create a file with the given name and write the generated text to file.
3. A text file is given. The text file contains numbers (in base 10) separated by spaces. Read the content of the file, determine the maximum number (from the numbers that have been read) and write the result at the end of file.
