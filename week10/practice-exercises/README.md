# Practice exercises
For the next problems, at least one subprogram should be implemented in a separated module:

0. Implement a recursive Fibonacci function (even if it is inefficient). Output to the screen the 32th Fibonacci number. Compare the execution time to a similar Python recursive implementation.
1. Multiple strings of characters are being read from the console. Determine whether the first appears as a subsequence in each of the others and give an appropriate message.
2. A list of numbers from the console is given. Output to the screen those numbers which are palindromes.
3. A phrase in English (maximum 1000 characters) is given. This phrase contains words and number. Find all numbers in the phrase and sum them up together. ("I would like 2 apples and 333 oranges": result is 335). For this, implement a string to integer parsing function in another submodule.
